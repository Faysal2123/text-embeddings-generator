# Text Embedding Generator

A lightweight web tool that transforms plain text into numerical vector embeddings using AI models. Ideal for powering search, similarity matching, and other NLP tasks.




## What is Embedding?

An embedding is a numerical representation of text in a high-dimensional vector space. It captures the meaning and context of the text, enabling machines to compare and understand human language more effectively.
